<h2>Origin Story</h2>

Setting out to establish data governance programs within our organization, I could not find meaningful first-hand accounts 
  or personal advice to assist my efforts. While academic sources and publications describe the technical requirements and systemic 
  changes required by DG creation, they often gloss past the business case and political concerns surrounding the implementation. Indeed, 
  a popular (and personally highly regarded) author writes in one footnote that if the case for DG must be made to executive leadership, 
  then we as data professionals must embark on education campaigns before starting the program.<br>
  
  
  ><em>What if that leadership is not receptive to education? If your position lacks authority to reverse the flow of instruction? If you 
    are hired as the only steward for a multinational corporation and told "make it right" with limited resources?</em><br>
  
  
  Answers to these questions are complex, but soluable into component pieces. Tackling each "soft" need is arduous to contain within a 
  single publication, especially when the goal is not to resolve interpersonal conflict, but to educate a data-wielding audience on 
  proper change management and accountability structure.<br>
  
  
  I contend that these are not separate concerns. Often, many "hidden" interdepartmental conflicts are exposed to a general audience for 
  the first time during DG scoping sessions. Formalized governance, including never-before-seen roles, budget allocation, responsibility 
  reassignment, quality control, and error rectification are __all__ inherently political tasks. Carrying out successful DG, and the 
  accompanying stewardship tasks, requires committment at each level of accountability. So let's punch up - for data sake!<br>
